TODO:
Finish creating lcms2.java
Create lcms2_internal.java

Create "public" functions for whatever can be public. Classes that are public in abstract but implemented internally should have a special class built to handle that (public class stuff{int internalValue;})

Implement other source files

Determine what/if internal structures can be discovered (keep it as if the only accessible items are those in the headers), if they can then make them public, otherwise internal.

Figure out what the high-level structures should be, then...
Create high-level structures that handle color management in a true OOP fashion.
