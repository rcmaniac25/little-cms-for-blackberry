Look-Up-File (LUF)

All lookup files are built using operations and attibutes. Every operation and attribute starts with '$'.

Types:
OP-Operation
AT-Attribute

Operations:
An operation has a start and end. Operation starts are prefixed with 'S', operation ends are prefixed with 'E'.

Types of Operations:
LUF-Definition of a LUF file
TYP-Definition of a type
FIE-Definition of a field
DEL-Definition of a delegate/interface
PRE-Definition of a preprocessor

Attributes:
An attribute is a, well, an attribute of something. An attribute is one line and MUST always be at the beginning of a element, never placed at random locations.

Types of attributes:
NAME-The name of the item
TYPE-The type of an item (predefined types: boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double, Object, *[])
PREPROC-Straight text duplicate of preprocessor
ATT-Raw type attributes (such as final)

Operations and their attributes/operations:
LUF:
Supported OPs: TYP, DEL, PRE

TYP:
Supported ATs: NAME
Supported OPs: FIE, TYP, DEL

FIE:
Supported ATs: NAME, TYPE, ATT
--Note: if name is "$ret" then it is considered a return type. This is only valid on DEL types.
--Note2: if the last FIE in a TYP is the same TYPE as as TYP then the output is changed. Instead of creating a different element every index it
	creates a temporary element and passes the previous instance into it. This is because it treats the last element as a "next" pointer.

DEL:
Supported ATs: NAME
Supported OPs: FIE

PRE:
Supported ATs: PREPROC
--Note: PREPROC can be used as an OP but is really an AT, thus start and end are not needed. This should only be done with multi-line preprocessors
